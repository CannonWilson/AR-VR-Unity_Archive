# VR-Meditation

### Description

Back in 2021, the meditation app I tried on the Oculus Quest felt too 
complicated, so I made my own simple meditation app for myself. Check 
out the demo.mp4 file to see the app.

Unused assets were cleaned up using the Unity Sweeper plugin.

### Features

The app shows the user a VR-compatible menu system that allows them to set a timer, pause/change the timer, choose between virtual environments, and select a background noise.

Once the chosen amount of time passes, a bell rings to signal the end of the meditation. There is also background music if you want to enable that.
