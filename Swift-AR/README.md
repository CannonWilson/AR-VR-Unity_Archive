# Swift AR

This was my first foray into developing AR apps
for the iOS ecosystem, and one of my first times
using Swift. Here are some learning outcomes:

- Learning Swift's structure and syntax
- Learning UIKit, SwiftUI, and their differences
- Learning the XCode development environment and deploying onto an iPhone
- Using RealityKit to render an AR Experiences on top of a camera feed

I later used this app as a starting point for 
other AR iOS projects. Please check out the demo
video to see this simple app in action.
