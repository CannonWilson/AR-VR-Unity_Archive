# English-Game-Demo

### Description

This is a proof of concept/demo for a video game to teach English and 
other languages that I created in my free time over a few weeks.
I was the sole programmer for this project, and we decided not to
pursue the project further due to other commitments. Check out
the demo.mp4 video to see what I made. 

Terrain (minimally modified using the
built-in terrain editor) and character model (not modified) were 
sourced from third-party packages. This was cleaned using the 
unity-sweeper package in order to reduce file size.

### Features

I started by making a player entity that moves and rotates with user input. Then, I created a basic dialogue menu that appears
when a character is approached. The character can choose between dialogue options to respond to the character they approached.

Next, I created a menu that allows the user to arrange words into phrases. The menu has drag and drop functionality, as well as
a button that responds to correct or incorrect input.
