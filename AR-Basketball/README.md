# AR-Basketball

**Project Status: Deprecated**

**Note:** This project is no longer actively maintained and contains known issues resulting from unused file cleanup with [Unity Sweeper](https://github.com/NotionTheory/unity-sweeper/tree/main).

## Overview

AR-Basketball was an early foray into Augmented Reality (AR) development, serving as an educational project that provided valuable insights into AR technologies. This endeavor was instrumental in gaining hands-on experience with the Unity engine while utilizing the experimental Oculus passthrough API, facilitating a deeper understanding of AR development. It's important to note that due to specific project settings (gitignored), cloning this project may present challenges.

### Key Learnings

Throughout the project, key learnings were acquired:

- **Oculus Passthrough Integration**: Setting up a Unity project to incorporate the Oculus passthrough API, which allows users to experience AR applications through their Oculus devices.

- **Realistic Physics Simulation**: Creating and fine-tuning physics materials to accurately replicate the bounce and behavior of basketballs within the AR environment.

- **XR Rig Integration**: Developing Oculus Virtual Reality (OVR) rigs for the camera and seamlessly integrating them with XR rigs and the XR Interaction Manager to enhance user interaction in a unified scene.

### Demo

You can view a demo video of the project, captured using SideQuest, a third-party application for recording passthrough API gameplay, within this repository.

## Features

**1. Goal Creation and Manipulation**

- Users have the ability to spawn a basketball goal by pressing the left grip button, offering flexibility to reposition and rotate the goal as desired.

**2. Ball Interaction**

- The project allows users to spawn a basketball by pressing the trigger button on their controllers. Releasing the trigger results in the natural throwing or dropping of the ball, complete with realistic bouncing off the ground or the goal structure.

**3. Scoring Mechanism**

- Engage in the basketball experience by shooting the ball through the hoop, an action that increases the displayed score on the backboard.

Please note that this project is no longer actively maintained but serves as a valuable testament to early AR development endeavors.
